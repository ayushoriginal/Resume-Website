    <p>
        A search engine for services for the intellectually disabled people in US.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was done in collaboration with students from two other international institutions - Penn State
        University, US and Serajevo Institute of Technology, Bosnia. A major challenge in the project was to work from
        distributed locations across the globe. Co-ordination was extremely difficult owing to the difference in time zone.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project involved developing a web app that can match an potential service seeker (an intellectually disabled user)
        to a service-provider who can satisfy user's need.
