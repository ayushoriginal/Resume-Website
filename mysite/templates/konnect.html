        Konnect is a mini TCP/IP stack implementation for file transfer from one system to the other over network.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was done as a part of the <i>Computer Communication and Networks Course</i> during my undergrad 
        in February 2014.
    </p>
        The objective behind this project was to learn the fundamentals of the computer networks and socket programming in C.

                Each layer adds the corresponding header and writes the data to a temporary file which is passed 
                to the next layer. A simple script is provided which takes the input file on the source machine 
                and process it through each layer one my one. The same script also processes received data and 
                processes it again through each layer to obtain original file on destination machine.
