    <p>
        It is a basic automatic web service retrieval mechanism based on 7-D vector space and co-sine similarity. 
        OWL is a service-description document which describes the document using rich semantics. We used this 
        document associated with each web service to search for desired service.

        This project was done as a part of <i>Web Technologies and Applications</i> course between September to November, 2014.
        This project was further improved as a part of <i>Web Services</i> course between January to April, 2015. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Web Service Interfaces was used to search for similar services. The &lt;&lt;<b>profile:hasinput</b>&gt;&gt; 
        and &lt;&lt;<b>profile:hasoutput</b>&gt;&gt; was extracted for around 1000+ OWL documents in our data-set. 
        Keywords in those interfaces was used to search for services. <br/>
        Semantic search was done using text description of services using NLP techniques.

                The web-services were classified into 7 categories :

                A 7-dimension vector space was considered where each of these mentioned category represents a dimension. Each 
                service as well as user's query is represented as a vector in this vector space. After this, co-sine similarity 
                is used to find services similar to user's query.

            For semantic search we extracted the text description, disambiguated all the words and establish
            the context for the service. We find services with similar context and combine with keyword search.
        </p>
        <p>
            For service composition we construct a DAG with each service as node and edges representing similar
            interfaces. To query, we do a DFS traversal and find the service with most similar output.
