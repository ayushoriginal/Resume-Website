        A graph based storage engine for efficient storage of data in a Relational Database. This project was done as a
        part of the <i>Minor Project</i> course during my undergrad in 6<sup>th</sup> semester from February to
        April 2015.
    </p>
    <p>
        It is an ambitious research project that aims to minimize the cost of aggregate and join queries in a relational 
        database. It also reduces data redundancy by storing each value in a relation only once.
    </p>
    <p>
        A relational database is modeled as a graph in our proposed scheme. Columns of each table is represented as a singly
        linked list. An actual row of a relational database is represented by a node in the main linked list (which represents 
        a table) and the edges from that node to different attribute nodes which store the actual values. In our model, columns
        can be shared between tables allowing us to model foreign key constraint.
    </p>
    <p>
        We were able to retrieve results of join queries in O(n) relative to O(n<sup>2</sup>) in traditional relational database.
        Our model is extremely scalable and has been tested with tens of GigaBytes of data

                The whole implementation was done using C++. The whole implementation is
                modular and strictly follows Object Oriented Paradigm. A few images on the
                right illustrates our proposed model. Pointers we used extensively to represent
                edges.
