    <p>
        A sand-boxing mechanism to run malicious / untrusted C and C++ codes. The main objective was to run a C/C++ code whose 
        origin or content is not known as such such codes pose serious threats to system's security.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was done as a part of the <i>Operating Systems</i> course during my undergrad between March 2014 to April 2014.

        <h5>Basic Working</h5>
        The execution of a typical C program is depicted in one of the images. Our program compiles the given code and prevents any 
        system calls made by the function except read-write from standard input and standard output. For memory allocation we provide 
        a custom implementation of malloc.h. If any system call is detected, the program is terminated with run time error.
    </p>

        <h5>Features</h5>
        The main features of the projects are : <br/><br/>
        <ul class='disk'>
            <li>SECCOMP was used to prevent malicious system calls</li>
            <li>Custom implementation of memory allocating functions in C/C++</li>
            <li>Provides simple interface to load and execute a program in sand-boxed environment via a script</li>
            <li>Pre-processing the program for commonly known malicious signature</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
