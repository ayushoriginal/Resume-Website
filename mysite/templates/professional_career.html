            I interned at Google's San Francisco Office during Summer 2015. Working for Google was like a dream come true for me. I worked with the cloud
            datastore team. Worked with the Cloud Datastore Team to create a sample application that demonstrates the best practices to use datastore. The django application uses NDB API and will help programmers acquainted with relational database to model and build scalable application with datastore. The application is accompanied by a blog post that discusses several design patterns that the application developers might encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sample application adresses many scalability issues that are usually encountered by application developers using datastore. The application will available for both App Engine and Compute Engine.

            During my short 1 month winter break, I interned at SimpleWealth, Bangalore. SimpleWealth is a fin-tech startup
            that helps users understand their finances, increase their financial knowledge and grow their wealth through simple
            steps. I had an opportunity to learn a lot during my internship. The experience exposed me to real-life problems
            in industry. My co-workers and mentors were extremely talented and I kept learning new things from them every day.
            The start-up was located in city downtown and we tried out new places to eat everyday.

                        My team consisted of 2 people. Our task was to implement methods to synchronize data between an android client
                        and central server. Data on Android clients was stored using SQLite and on the server both MongoDB and MySQL
                        was used. Both kinds of data was considered - Master Data (once single copy on server for all clients) as well
                        as Transaction Data (one corresponding copy on server for each client). The objective was achieved using various
                        audit fields. My main contributions were :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Carried out a brief literature survey on best practices and available implementations</li>
                            <li>Designed a server-side conflict resolution mechanism based on audit fields</li>
                            <li>Optimization of synchronization mechanism for slow and erratic network by compressing data</li>
                            <li>Developed an efficient mechanism to schedule synchronization</li>
                            <li>Batching Network as well as I/O Operations</li>
                            <li>Measured performance under various simulated network condition (latency and rate of data transfer)</li>
                            <li>New mechanism was found to be 36% faster and consumed 23% less bandwidth</li>

            I interned at IIT Bombay during my summer break of 2014. It is one the finest research and engineering institute in India.
            I worked as a part of the Fundamental Research Group, Dept. of CSE. I had a first-hand experience of theoretical computer
            science. I read a lot of research papers and also published one during the internship. I worked about 45 hrs each week.
            My mentor always had interesting inputs for me which helped me learn a lot. I made some wonderful friends during the
            course of my internship. Mumbai is a city which never sleeps and I throughly enjoyed our frequent parties and outings.

                        My team consisted of 4 people - all 4 from different engineering institute in India. The main objective was to improve
                        the way a student learns new concepts via an E-Learning platform (EdX and Moodle in particular). We realized than an
                        effective E-Learning platform needs to adapt itself to the user's need. We explored the various ways of collecting,
                        storing and finally utilizing useful information about the user, instructor and learning material to aid the process
                        of personalization. My main responsibilities were :
                        <ul>
                            <li>Examined the Data available on <a href="https://moodle.org/">Moodle</a> and <a href="https://www.edx.org/">EdX</a></li>
                            <li>Designed and Implemented a new user model to model a user in terms of data</li>
                            <li>Developed a semi-automatic concept mapping mechanism using question-concept relationship</li>
                            <li>Implemented popular algorithms like Collaborative Filtering and Co-Sine Similarity to find similar concepts</li>
                            <li>Developed a Directed Graph based polynomial-time algorithm to recommend next best concept to user</li>
                            <li>Implemented a feedback mechanism and a Pershiva based System Evaluation with Recall and Precision parameters</li>
                            <li>The new recommendation feature was found useful by 78% user decreased average course completion time by 30%</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All implementation was done using a django-app so that it can be easily integrated with EdX which is also powered by Django. We used tools like Celery and RabbitMQ to queue computationally demanding items. Standard MySQL was used as the database. A nice GUI was developed using bootstrap and JQuery. More details about our implementation can be found in the project report.

            I was a Summer Trainee at Globsyn Finishing School. It is a specialized center of education which helps undergraduate
            students develop their programming skills during their vacation. Each week required 45 hrs of effort. Every training
            session was like a small scale hackathon - where I had to innovate, design and build. The training had both classroom
            as well as practical components.
