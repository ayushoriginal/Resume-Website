                    I am 21 years old. I am tall (about ~ 187cm) but I weigh about 128 lbs (58 kgs). My eyesight is a little weak mostly because of the 
                    long hours I spend in-front of display terminals. First thing, I do not like being social - 
                    mostly because I do not know what it exactly means! I belong to a very diverse Indian joint family of more than 20 people.
                    I like music + hot cappuccino + black / green terminal and that is why I am often seen with all three of it. Like most
                    engineers in India, I usually sleep late at night. I like watching movies, music videos, TV Shows, Animes and Documentaries.
                    Apart from Computer Science, I am also interested in particle physics. My Primary Gods include - David Gilmour, Stephen Hawking,
                    Steve Jobs and Alan Turing.

                    My failures have motivated me more than my achievements. I work as hard as possible. I am usually good at working under pressure
                    with an upcoming deadline to meet. I also like self-learning usually via web. I hate reading books - novels, technical,
                    academic, etc - all of it. I am not patient enough to read a whole book. I love debating especially technical debate among
                    a small set of people. I am rarely angry. I am a vegetarian and like trying out new dishes and cuisine. I maintain a digital
                    diary and occasionally write stuff. I have traveled through 21/29 states in India. I have visited 2 other countries apart from
                    India i.e., UAE and US.

                    I grew up in Kolkata, India along with a number of cousins. So my childhood was a happy one (:P). I was only an above-average
                    student at my primary school. I was always good with Mathematics. After primary education, I attended Birla High School - one
                    of the best schools in Eastern India. It played a pivotal role in my academic career. However, I failed to get a branch of my
                    choice in any of the IITs and thus I joined NITK Surathkal. I made a lot of friends here. I learn a lot here - everyday. I took
                    up a couple of leadership roles too. Currently, I am in my senior year. I try to learn from everyone here. I also try to help
                    others as much as possible. I lived in Mumbai for a couple of months  - which was awesome. I also went to San Francisco to
                    intern at Google during summer 2015 - which by far is the most prominent achievement of my life.

                    I use ashish1294 as the username / handle for most of my web accounts. It represents my date of birth i.e., 1294 = 1/2/94. <br/>
                    My team i.e., Bug Assassins is one of the most important things in my life.
