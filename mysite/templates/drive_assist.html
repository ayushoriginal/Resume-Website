        A Windows Store Application that uses Microsoft Kinnect v2 for Windows to prevent road accidents by determining in the driver is drowsy. 
  </p>
    <p>
        This project was done as a part of the <i>Code.Fun.Do</i> hackathon organized by Microsoft during my 
        undergrad in February 2015. My team Bug Assassins was declared runners up for this application.
    </p>
    <p>
        The application uses several data provided by the Microsoft Kinect SDK. The Kinect is installed in-front
        of the driver and regularly monitors the drivers head. It extracts details from the driver's face to
        determine if the driver is sleepy and if the driver is caught sleepy an alarm is triggered.
