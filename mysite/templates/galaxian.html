        A traveller of the skies - Guide your space-ship through the sea of cosmos. Galaxian is an Open-GL 
        based "old-days" type classic 2D game.
    </p>
    <p>
        This project was done as a part of the <i>Computer Graphics</i> course during my undergrad between 
        March 2014 to April 2014.
    </p>
    <p>
        The project was made with an objective of learning 2D Animations and basic transformations. It has 
        been written in C++ but can be converted to C without much effort (No Classes). This game is 
        inspired by the classical DOS-era shooting games.

            Along with the main game, all the basic functions of a graphics engine like Line Drawing, Circle Drawing, 
            Ellipse Drawing, Scan-Line Polygon Fill, Line Clipping, Polygon Clipping and 3-D transformations (translation, 
            rotation and scaling) was also implemented.
